    1. Combine exercise 1 of Part B in Lab 5 with exercise 2 of Part B in Lab 4 (hence, the scanner recognizes identifiers and numbers from an input text file).  

Let’s assume that we are using the input file to describe the movements of a robot. 
    • LEFT number means that the robot moves number units to the left from the current positon. 
    • RIGHT number means the robot moves number units to the right from the current position. 
    • UP number means that the robot moves number units up from the current position. 
    • DOWN number means the robot moves number units down from the current position. 
    • INITIAL number number represents the initial coordinates (x and y) of the robot. 
Display on the screen the position after each command and the final position of the robot after executing all the LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN commands starting from the starting point as described by INITIAL. INITIAL is the first command in the file. All commands are given in an input file.
