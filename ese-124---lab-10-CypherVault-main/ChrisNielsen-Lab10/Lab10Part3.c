Modify the queue to implement a circular queue. Such a queue wraps around back to index 0, 
after the index for adding a new value to the queue reached the last entry of the 1 D array implementing the circular queue.
  Use the ADT to solve the following problem:
    • The Josephus Problem: There are n people standing in a circle waiting to be executed. 
	After the first man is executed, k - 1 people are skipped and the k-th man is executed.
	 Then again, k-1 people are skipped and the k-th man is executed. 
	 The elimination proceeds around the circle (which is becoming smaller and smaller as the executed people are removed), 
	 until only the last man remains, who is given freedom. The task is to choose the place in the initial circle so that you survive, given n and k.
